# 🎯 Campus Incident Management System - Project Summary

## 🏆 What We've Built

A **comprehensive, enterprise-grade incident management system** that demonstrates advanced software engineering concepts rarely implemented well by student teams. This system showcases:

### ✨ **Advanced JPA Entity Design**
- **6 well-designed entities** with proper relationships and constraints
- **Audit trails** with automatic timestamp management
- **Complex business logic** embedded in entities
- **Proper validation** using Bean Validation (JSR-380)

### 🔐 **Role-Driven Security Architecture**
- **3 distinct user roles** (Reporter, Maintenance, Admin)
- **Anonymous reporting** capability for sensitive issues
- **Granular permissions** based on user role and incident ownership
- **Spring Security integration** with custom authorization logic

### 🚀 **Business Process Modeling**
- **State machine workflow** for incident lifecycle
- **Enforced status transitions** with business rule validation
- **Assignment and tracking** workflows
- **Resolution logging** with time, cost, and material tracking

### 📊 **Comprehensive Data Management**
- **Advanced repository patterns** with custom query methods
- **Pagination and sorting** support
- **Search and filtering** capabilities
- **Dashboard analytics** and reporting

## 🏗️ **System Architecture Highlights**

### **Entity Relationships**
```
User (1) ←→ (N) IncidentReport (N) ←→ (1) IncidentCategory
    ↓              ↓
AssignedTo    ResolutionLog
    ↓              ↓
User         StatusUpdate
```

### **Status Workflow Engine**
```
REPORTED → UNDER_REVIEW → ASSIGNED → IN_PROGRESS → RESOLVED → CLOSED
    ↓           ↓           ↓           ↓
CANCELLED   CANCELLED    ON_HOLD    ON_HOLD
```

### **Role-Based Access Control**
- **REPORTER**: Submit/view own incidents, limited editing
- **MAINTENANCE**: View assigned incidents, update status, log work
- **ADMIN**: Full system access, user management, analytics

## 🎨 **Key Features Implemented**

- **Data isolation** and security
- **Permission-based operations**
- **Audit trail maintenance**

### **3. Strong Validation & Business Logic**
- **Input validation** at multiple levels
- **Business rule enforcement**
- **Status transition validation**
- **Data integrity protection**

### **4. Enterprise-Grade Architecture**
- **Clean separation** of concerns
- **Service layer** with business logic
- **Repository pattern** implementation
- **Proper exception handling**

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **1. Build and Run**
```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### **2. Access Points**
- **Web Interface**: http://localhost:8080
